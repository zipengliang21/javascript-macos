## Command Line Interfaces

### Install Dependencies
After cloning the repo, run `npm install` to install dependencies.

### Code Style
If your commit fails, it is probably due to code style problems. Run `npm run check` to check for code style problems and run `npm run fix` to fix problems that can be fixed automatically (e.g. indentation).

### Development
Start development server by running `npm run start`.

### Build
Create a production build by running `npm run build`.

### Deploy
After creating a production build, deploy to GitHub Pages by running `npm run deploy`. However, it is necessary to do manual deployment like this because automatic deployment has been set up with GitHub Actions.
